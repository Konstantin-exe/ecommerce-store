        'A Plumbus is an all-purpose home device. Everyone knows what it does, so there is no reason to explain it. It is described as a common household and office item that is also used as an accent piece to a room. According to Stealy, Plumbuses are worth six-and-a-half Brapples. Plumbuses are created on Plumbubo Prime 51b. They use Mortys for maintenance and other menial tasks. Known employees are Plumbus Slave Morty, Plumbus Worker Morty, Plumbus Master Morty, Plumbus Prawn Morty, and Plumbonia Morty. Working in a factory is very dangerous for a Morty. Repurposed Fleeb Juice, combined with tight spaces, can cause a Morty/Alien hybrid such as Plumbonia Morty. Morty/Plumbus protein strands can cause mutations to occur in Mortys such as Plumbus Prawn Morty. In Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality, Rick has a Plumbus in the garage. The Plumbus can be combined with other items to create different colors of Plumbus. One of the aliens that work at the plumbus factory are Blamphs, and another is a Shlaammi.',
